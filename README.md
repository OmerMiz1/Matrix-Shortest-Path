# Algorithmic-Programming-2
2nd Milestone Of First Semester

Project made as part of out Algorithmic programming course. The main goal of the project is to practice generics.
The program can run a multi-threaded TCP server, each server can support clients with specific problems to solve such as Matrix paths and string reversing.

# The Algorithms
Currently, we support the following graph (matrix) search algorithms:

1. BFS
2. DFS
3. BestFS
4. AStar

# Results
We tested which algorithm had the best results in means of costs per path (avg). The results indicated that BestFS had the best results amongst the algorithms, although in reality AStar is supposed to be the prefferable.

# INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Go into Main.cpp and choose your desired searcher (it is possible to use the second line in main.cpp also with no arguments)
1. Compile the program.
2. Run the program with an int argument for port (if no port is given, default will be set to 5600).  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOTE: This is the port that the server will be listening to.
3. Solutions can be found at the same folder where the compiled program files are.
